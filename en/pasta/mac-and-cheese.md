## Instructions

### 1. Cook the pasta (8–10 min)
Cook macaroni in salted boiling water until **al dente**. Drain and reserve **1 cup of cooking water**.

### 2. Cook the ground beef (5–7 min)
In a large skillet, heat a little oil or 1 tbsp butter. Add the ground beef, season with salt and pepper, and cook until browned. Break it up with a spatula as it cooks. Add the onion and garlic and cook 2–3 minutes more until softened. Remove from heat and set aside.

### 3. Prepare the cheese sauce (10 min)
In a saucepan, melt **40 g butter** over medium heat. Add **40 g flour** and stir for 1–2 minutes (making a roux). Gradually pour in the milk while whisking to avoid lumps. Cook on medium-low until the sauce thickens and coats the spoon. Remove from heat, add mustard and nutmeg. Stir in cheddar and parmesan, mixing gently until smooth.

### 4. Combine everything (2–3 min)
Add the cooked beef mixture into the cheese sauce. Stir in the macaroni until evenly coated. If too thick, add some reserved pasta water.

### 5. Bake and gratin (optional, 10–12 min)
Transfer to an oven-safe dish. Mix breadcrumbs with melted butter and sprinkle on top with extra cheese. Bake at **200 °C (400 °F)** for 10–12 minutes until golden and crispy.

## Tips
- **For juicier beef**: don’t overcook it before mixing with the sauce.
- **Extra flavor**: add a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the beef.
- **Vegetables**: cook separately (peas, broccoli, mushrooms) for picky eaters to add later.
- **Storage**: keeps 3–4 days in the fridge. Reheat with a splash of milk. Freeze before baking for better results.
