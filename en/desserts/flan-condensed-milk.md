### Step-by-step instructions

#### 1. Make the caramel
1. In a small saucepan, combine sugar and water over medium heat.
2. Do **not** stir with a spoon; just let the sugar dissolve slowly.
3. At first, it will look **white and bubbly** — that’s the water evaporating.
4. After a few minutes, it will turn **clear**, then gradually a **golden amber color**.
5. Immediately pour the caramel into your mold, tilting to coat the bottom.

 Be careful: hot caramel is very dangerous and hardens fast.

#### 2. Make the custard mixture
1. In a large bowl (or blender), combine:
   - Sweetened condensed milk
   - Evaporated (or whole) milk
   - Eggs
   - Vanilla
2. Whisk until smooth and homogeneous.
   *(If using a blender, pulse in short bursts to avoid foam)*.
3. Pour over the hardened caramel in the mold.

#### 3. Bake in a water bath
1. Preheat oven to **350 °F (175 °C)**.
2. Place the mold with the flan into a larger baking dish.
3. Pour in hot water until it reaches **halfway up the mold**.
4. Cover loosely with aluminum foil to prevent water from dripping inside.
5. Bake for **50–60 minutes**, or until a toothpick comes out mostly clean (slightly damp is fine).

#### 4. Chill and unmold
1. Remove from oven and let cool in the water bath for 15 minutes.
2. Take the mold out of the water and let cool to room temperature.
3. Refrigerate at least **4 hours or overnight**.
4. To unmold: run a knife along the edges, place a plate on top, and flip quickly. The caramel syrup will flow over the flan.

### Tips
- For a firmer flan, add 1 extra egg.
- For a creamier flan, use only 3 eggs.
- Glass molds may take longer than metal, so check doneness carefully.
- Don’t let the caramel get too dark — it will taste bitter.
