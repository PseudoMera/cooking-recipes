## Step-by-step preparation

### 1. Prepare the base
1. Crush the cookies until they are powdery.  
   - You can do this with a food processor or by putting the cookies in a bag and crushing them with a rolling pin or bottle.  
2. Mix the crushed cookies with the melted butter.  
3. Place the mixture in the bottom of your glass tray or mold.  
4. Press down firmly with a spoon to compact the base.  
5. Store in the refrigerator while you prepare the filling.

### 2. Prepare the filling
1. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with the sugar until smooth.  
2. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.  
3. Add the cream, flour, vanilla, and lemon zest (if using).  
4. Mix gently, without overbeating, to avoid incorporating too much air.

### 3. Baking
1. Preheat the oven to **170 °C (340 °F)**.  
2. Pour the filling mixture over the cookie base.  
3. Bake for **50–60 minutes**.  
   - If using a glass tray, it may take 10 minutes longer.  
   - The center should still be slightly jiggly when moving the tray.

### 4. Resting in the oven
1. Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside.  
2. Keep the door **slightly open** a few centimeters.  
3. Let it rest for **30–60 minutes** so it cools slowly and doesn’t crack.

### 5. Cooling
1. Carefully remove the tray and let it cool at room temperature for about 20–30 minutes.  
2. Cover with aluminum foil (if you don’t have plastic wrap) or place a large bowl upside down as an improvised lid.  
3. Refrigerate for **at least 4 hours**, though ideally overnight.

### 6. Serving
1. Just before serving, add the topping of jam or fresh fruit.  
2. For clean slices, heat a knife in hot water and dry it before cutting.
